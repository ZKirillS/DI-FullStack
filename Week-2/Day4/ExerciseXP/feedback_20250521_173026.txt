suggestions for improvement:
- Skipping file (too many comments or blank lines).

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only addresses Exercise 2.  Exercise 1, the random sentence generator, is missing entirely.
- The date format in the 'birth_date' key should adhere to 'YYYY-MM-DD' as specified, currently it is 'YYYY/MM/DD'.
- Error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) should be included for file operations and user input validation in Exercise 1 (if it were implemented).
- The code for Exercise 2 is missing the file saving step.  It only shows the modified JSON data structure.

suggestions for improvement:
- In `get_word_from_file`, handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions.  The current code will crash if the file doesn't exist.
- Improve error handling in `main`. Instead of just printing an error and exiting, provide more user-friendly feedback and allow the user to retry input.
- The function `get_word_from_file` should take the file path as an argument for better flexibility and reusability, rather than hardcoding the path.
- In `get_random_sentence`, using `random.sample` is good for avoiding duplicate words. Consider adding a check to ensure that the word list has at least `length` words; otherwise, `random.sample` will throw an error.
- In Exercise 2, use a more descriptive variable name than `sampleJson` (e.g., `json_data`).
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each section in both exercises.
