suggestions for improvement:
- Challenge 1: The code for Challenge 1 correctly sorts the words alphabetically and joins them with commas, fulfilling the core requirement. However, it doesn't explicitly handle potential errors like empty input or input with only commas.  Adding input validation would improve robustness.
- Challenge 1:  While the use of list comprehension is concise, a more descriptive variable name than `char` would improve readability.  For example, `word` would be more appropriate.
- Challenge 2: The `longest_word` function correctly identifies the longest word in a sentence, adhering to the instructions.  The code is efficient and functions correctly for the given test cases.
- Challenge 2: Consider adding a check for an empty input string to the `longest_word` function for better error handling.  If the input is empty, it should perhaps return an empty string or raise an exception.
- General:  Adding docstrings to both functions would greatly enhance readability and understanding.
Brief justification:
- correctness: Challenge 1's code largely fulfills the requirements of sorting a comma-separated string of words. It correctly uses `split()` to separate words, `sorted()` to sort them, and `join()` to recombine.  Challenge 2's function accurately finds the longest word in the test cases provided, correctly handling punctuation as part of the words.  The small deduction is due to missing error handling.
- readability: The code is generally readable, but improvements could be made by using more descriptive variable names (e.g., in Challenge 1, `word` instead of `char`). Adding docstrings to explain each function would further improve readability.  The comments in the code are somewhat minimal and could be expanded to better explain the logic, especially in the `longest_word` function.
- performance: The algorithms used in both challenges are efficient. The sorting in Challenge 1 has O(n log n) complexity, and the longest word search in Challenge 2 is O(n), where n is the number of words.  No significant performance issues are apparent. The efficiency is good for the problem size expected in the context of the chapter.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code only processes user input and performs string manipulations; it does not interact with external resources or handle sensitive data.
