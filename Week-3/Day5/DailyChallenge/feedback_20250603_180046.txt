suggestions for improvement:
- Improve styling to better match the provided image.  The current styling is functional but lacks the visual details of the example.
- Add error handling for cases where the `tasks` array might be unexpectedly empty or manipulated.
- Consider using a more robust method for managing unique task IDs, especially in scenarios involving concurrent users or complex interactions.
- The `renderTasks` function re-renders the entire list each time. For very large lists, this could be inefficient. Consider using a more targeted update approach (diffing algorithm).
