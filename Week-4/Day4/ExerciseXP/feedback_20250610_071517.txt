suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1: The function should explicitly return the resolved value in the `then` block, not just log it to the console.  The exercise implies a return value is expected by the `.then` handler.
- Exercise 2: The exercise asks to create a promise that resolves in 4 seconds and returns 'success'.  The current code resolves immediately with 'success'. It should use `setTimeout` to introduce the delay.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each function and the logic within them. This will improve code understanding and maintainability.
