suggestions for improvement:
- Add input validation to handle unexpected or malicious user input (though the `rating=g` parameter already helps mitigate some risks).
- Improve error handling to provide more user-friendly error messages instead of just logging to the console.
- Consider adding loading indicators to improve user experience while fetching the GIF.
- The code could benefit from more descriptive variable names (e.g., instead of `gifWrapper`, use `gifContainerElement`).
