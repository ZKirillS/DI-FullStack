suggestions for improvement:
- The code could be slightly improved by using more descriptive variable names. For example, instead of `winners`, consider `highScoringPlayers`.  This enhances readability.
- While the code functions correctly, adding comments explaining the purpose of each section would boost readability further. This is particularly beneficial for others reviewing the code.
- Consider using `reduce` for calculating the total score instead of `forEach`.  While the performance difference is negligible here, `reduce` is more idiomatic for summing array elements.
